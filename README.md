## 📖 Overview

**CadGrab** is a powerful, automated Python scraper and download manager designed to extract, organize, and rename 3D CAD (`.step`) files from the most popular FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) robotics vendors.

### Supported Vendors:
1. 🟠 **goBILDA**
2. 🟣 **REV Robotics**
3. 🔵 **AndyMark** *(Beta)*

Unlike standard web scrapers, vendors often hide their product variations (like lengths of U-Channel or motor gear ratios) inside Javascript rendering engines, making them invisible to regular crawling. **CadGrab** solves this by using a hybrid engine: it parses raw XML sitemaps to discover base products, then completely bypasses JS obfuscation using a **Universal Multithreaded Regex Spider** to rip every valid product URL directly from the hidden HTML map.

---

## ✨ Features

- ⚡️ **Multi-Site Architecture:** One script to rule them all. Scrape all 3 major vendors at once, or select just one via the interactive CLI prompt.
- 📂 **Smart Directory Organization:** Programmatically reads website breadcrumbs to automatically build a perfectly categorized folder directory merging all vendors seamlessly (e.g., `CAD_Files/MOTION/Motors`).
- 🛡️ **Path Sanitization:** Automatically truncates folder paths and wipes invalid Windows characters (like `3/16"`) to prevent OS-level path crashes and respect `MAX_PATH` limits.
- 🏷️ **Intelligent Auto-Renaming:** Standardizes and intelligently shortens file names. Say goodbye to long "Series" prefixes and trademark symbols. Your Fusion 360 library will look pristine.
- ⏭️ **Smart Duplicate Skipping:** Stop the script halfway? No problem. It memorizes what it has collected and instantly skips pre-downloaded files upon restart to save massive bandwidth.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Marcus-Minions/CadGrab-FTC.git
   cd CadGrab-FTC
   ```
2. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Scraper

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python cad_grab.py
   ```
3. An interactive prompt will appear:
   ```text
   Select websites to scrape CAD parts from:
   [1] goBILDA
   [2] REV Robotics
   [3] AndyMark
   [4] ALL of the above
   
   Enter choice (1-4):
   ```
4. **Sit back and relax.** The script will create a root `CAD_Files` directory and begin placing thousands of `.step` files perfectly into categorized sub-folders!

> **💡 Pro Tip:** Change `DRY_RUN = True` inside `cad_grab.py` if you simply want to scan the sites and preview the file output paths without utilizing network data.

## 🛠 Fusion 360 Integration

If you want to quickly bulk import all of these downloaded `.step` files while completely preserving their exact folder categories inside your Autodesk Fusion 360 Data Panel, this repository includes our custom **CadGrab Fusion 360 Add-In**!

1. Open Fusion 360 and navigate to the **Design** workspace.
2. Select **Utilities** > **Scripts and Add-Ins** (or press `Shift + S`).
3. Under the **Scripts** tab, click the green `+` icon next to **My Scripts**.
4. Select the `FusionScript` folder located inside your cloned `CadGrab-FTC` directory.
5. Click **Run** on the `CadGrab_Fusion_Import` script!
6. A dialog will prompt you to select the exact `CAD_Files` folder that the scraper built.
7. Select exactly which categories to upload (e.g., "Check *Motion*", "Uncheck *Hardware*").
8. Fusion will now replicate the folders perfectly into your cloud Project!

> **⚠️ Note:** This process can take a significant amount of time depending on the number of files and your internet upload speed. Importing the *entire* goBILDA library takes approximately 3 hours. If you cancel it, running it again will instantaneously skip duplicates thanks to the Add-In's memory cache!
